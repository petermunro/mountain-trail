As a member of the Task Force collection the LOWA Patrol Boots brown whilst inheriting all the qualities, technical attributes and comfort of the LOWA Mountain Gore-Tex® Boot the LOWA Patrol Boot in Brown does not feature a Gore-Tex® membrane, but instead offers a single Cambrelle® hard wearing lining. The LOWA Patrol Boots in the new MOD Brown therefore offers a quicker drying time to those who find Gore-Tex® unnecessary for certain tasks. Cambrelle® as a synthetic lining is insulated for colder climates and ventilated for warmer climates.

Smart, durable, easy to look after, and with all of LOWA's fantastic foot technology combined in a boot for the discerning professional. This makes the brown LOWA Patrol
